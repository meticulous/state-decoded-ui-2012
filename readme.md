# ReadMe for The State Decoded design

This is the static breakout of The State Decoded design created in the fall of 2012. This is a combination of boilerplate as well as other functions that come from a variety of resources online, including the Ruby/Sass community. Any questions can be directed at myself (John Athayde) or Waldo Jaquith.

Cheers,

## Setup

### Favicons, Apple Touch Icons

Each of these icons should somehow correlate to your State or Commonwealth. With Virginia, we used the seal icon that was created for the site. The larger touch icons have bitmapped 0 and 1s fading across, representing digital bits being "decoded" as it were. Feel free to edit the images in the source_psd folder to suit your needs. We recommend running any images through ImageOptim (http://imageoptim.com) to squeeze out excess file size.
