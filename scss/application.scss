/* Application SCSS for The State Decoded

   To use this file, you need to use some kind of Sass processor. THe easiest
   way to do this is to use the Gemfile in this application and then use Ruby
   and bundler to install it. If you're using OS X, Ruby should be built in. If
   not, you may want to search around for the best way to use this file.

   The CSS in the /css directory is generated from this file. While you can edit
   the standard CSS, any changes made there will not be saved if you edit and
   later reprocess this file.

   The easiest setup is to use 'sass --watch' or an application like CodeKit to
   automatically process this file.

   Typically, you would not write styles in this file, but include files here
   in order to make for an easier to manage development environment.

   Remember, attributes are one per line and in alphabetical order. We use
   combination attributes whenever possible for conciseness.
